NYC Citibike with Tableau

## Purpose: 

- Use Tableau to import data and create worksheets, dashboards, and stories
- Utilize Tableau to portray the data in a visually professional and coherent way

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The city of Des Moines, IA has requested bikeshare data to be analyzed to determine the feasibility of a bikeshare program there. Citibike data from New York City's program for the month of August 2019 was used to determine whether or not this would be a good investment for Des Moines.  


## Cleaning the Data:
Jupyter Notebook was used to change the trip duration data to a datetime field.
